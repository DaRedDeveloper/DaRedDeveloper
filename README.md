<h1>Hello!</h1>
<b><p>I am a replit user and my name is <a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/@DaxCodes/" >DaxCodes!</a></p></b>
<p>I love to code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because it is way better than <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> or <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Background Info</h2>
<p>I started to program in HTML when I was about 5 years old. My mom helped me read the coding book and I just wrote the code. (I did understand what it did!)</p>
<p>Now I am 10 years old and I am a good programmer :D</p>

<h2>Friends</h2>
<p>My programming friends are:</p>
<p><a href="https://replit.com/@sqcodes/">SQCodes</a></p>
<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/pugdude9/">PugDude9</a></p>
